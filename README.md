## Just a Practice
So there is no comment.

And the code is terribly arbitrary.

Besides, as a newbie of C++, I use it 'cause LLVM's native interface is in C++, and spending time porting the interface to, for example, Go language, which I'd like to use, is another trouble, though learning and writing C++ code at the same time may be a larger trouble, but I need to learn some thing from the terrible language, sooner or later.

## TODO

code generation : from AST to LLVM IR

LLVM JIT : can it beat traditional static compiling?
